# Med_Shakthi 🩺💊

Med_Shakthi is a **Flutter-based internship project** developed under **UptoSkills** as part of my role as a **Flutter App Development Intern**.  
This project focuses on building a **real-world mobile application** with clean UI, backend integration, and practical state management rather than tutorial-level features.

## 📌 Project Overview

Med_Shakthi is designed to simulate a healthcare/medicine-related application with emphasis on:
- Scalable Flutter UI
- Secure authentication
- Real-time and persistent data handling
- Production-like app behavior

This project helped me understand how **actual apps behave in real conditions**, including data sync, refresh handling, and state consistency.
